# Contributing to Knuu

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Knuu. It's people like you that make Knuu such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repo and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #28 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 28-add-japanese-localization ```

Get the test suite running

Make sure you're testing your changes! It's important to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality and that they're the improvements you expect.

Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with the latest Knuu master branch:

``` sh
Copy code
git remote add upstream git@github.com:celestiaorg/knuu.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master ```
Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master and push it!

sh
Copy code
git checkout 28-add-japanese-localization
git rebase master
git push --set-upstream origin 28-add-japanese-localization
Go to the Knuu repo and make a Pull Request. The maintainers will review your PR and merge it if everything looks good.

Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if:

It is passing CI.
It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer who opened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
It has no requested changes.
It is up to date with current master.
Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are met.

Thank you!

Thanks again for your contribution, we truly appreciate it. :tada:
